zq-game-engine
==============

A JavaScript game engine built on the [mean.io](http://mean.io/) stack.

Interesting stuff is in the [packages](https://github.com/mrcarmody/zq-game-engine/tree/master/packages) directory.

This is definitely a work in progress and still rough on the edges, but to deploy the app, clone git repo and run `npm install` in the project directory.  Then run `grunt` to launch the dev server or `grunt test` to run the tests.
